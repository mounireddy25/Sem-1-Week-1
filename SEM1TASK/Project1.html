    <h2>Preparation steps:</h2>
    <ol style="font-size: 25px;">
        <li>Begin by bringing the milk to a gentle simmer in a pot. Do stir in between to make sure that milk is not sticking to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>On a separate stove, heat ghee in a pan on medium heat. Add chopped cashews and almonds and roast until they get a golden hue. Once done, drain any excess ghee and transfer the roasted nuts to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Now the milk is getting hot, set aside about 2 tablespoons of hot milk in a small bowl. Add saffron strands to this milk and allow it to sit so the saffron releases its beautiful color and aromatic flavor.</li>
        <li>Back to another stove, in the remaining ghee, roast the thick vermicelli until it turns a lovely golden brown. Keep stirring constantly to get even color.</li>
        <li>Pour the simmering hot milk into the roasted vermicelli. Allow this mixture to cook for 10-13 minutes or until vermicelli is fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and continue simmering the mixture for 5-7 minutes or until the seviyan kheer thickens to the perfect Kheer-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Add the roasted cashews, almonds, and raisins. Also, add the saffron milk and aromatic green cardamom seeds powder. Mix and enjoy!</li>
